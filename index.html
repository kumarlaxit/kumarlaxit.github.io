 <p>TikTok vs YouTube is the newest war on the internet where content creators of each platform are roasting those of the other. 
 The digital battle between these platforms has aroused a new sense of hatred on the internet at a time when policymakers are
 already deliberating on ways to make the virtual world more secure, reliable and accountable for consumers.
 </p>
 <p>YouTube vs TikTok battle reached its pinnacle when YouTube sensation CarryMinati, who has 18.4 million 
 subscribers, published a video titled TikTok vs YouTube-The End Game in which he roasted TikTok 
 fame, Amir Siddiqui. CarryMinati’s video was viewed over 78 million times after which it was taken off 
 the Google-owned platform. He released another video on May 17 titled Stop making assumptions | <b>YouTube vs  Tik Tok:</b>
The End where he said he does not understand why the video was taken down and asked his viewers to not 
make assumptions and misconstrue his puns. The controversy escalated further when TikToker Faisal Siddiqui posted a
 video endorsing acid attacks.

The YouTube vs TikTok debate might seem like trivial masala news but it is, on the contrary, a debate 
that has deeply-rooted social and cultural contexts. What appears to be a battle between CarryMinati and
 Amir Siddiqui might have your son or daughter involved too. 
</p>
<h4>What's the debate all about? Below are some points:</h4>
<h11>Casteist and classist slurs</h11>
<p>Making a YouTube video does not require large investment but progressing towards making a YouTube channel with
 millions of subscribers involves having technical equipment and software that those somehow making ends meet 
may not be able to afford. Whereas on TikTok, just about anybody can download the app, record a video and
 upload it. YouTubers, who usually have the luxury of time and resources on their hand, are often accused
 of hurling casteist and classist slurs at TikTokers, comparing TikTok content creators to the so-called 
"lower" strata of the society.</p>
<br>
<h10>Active vs passive viewing</h10>
<p>TikTok, which is an extremely addictive platform, is said to offer only passive entertainment to the 
audience. The maximum length of a TikTok video can be 60 seconds and YouTubers say that users only 
mindlessly scroll through their TikTok feed, for hours at length. There is also another point that such a 
format is detrimental for an individual’s attention span and for building focus. YouTube, on the other 
hand, allows more active participation of its audience, wherein they can search for any content they’re
 interested in watching. For instance, there was news lately where a teenager was able to save the life 
of a friend by performing a CPR which he learnt on YouTube.
</p>
<br>
<h7>Information dissemination</h7>
<p>YouTubers say that content creators on TikTok are merely those who don’t have anything to do and are only 
there for “time-pass”. Some YouTube content creators allege that people on TikTok make huge amounts of 
money without doing anything substantial. YouTubers, on the other hand, often have to devote long hours 
researching and editing videos before growing the number of their subscribers. They say while YouTube can 
offer information and knowledge, it is really tough to learn anything in the short duration of TikTok 
videos that are usually only 15 seconds long.
</p>
<br><h8>Derogatory and offensive content</h8>
<p>There have been multiple pleas in the past to ban TikTok in India. The app was banned in India last year 
for promoting derogatory content after which TikTok removed around six million videos from the platform.
 Recently, the rating of the app on Google Play dropped to 1.3 stars from 4.5 after Netizens demanded a 
ban on the app post backlash in India. #BanTikTok was also trending on Twitter after some TikTokers 
appeared to promote social evils like acid attacks and rape.</p><br>
<h9>Ownership of platforms</h9>
<p>While YouTube is owned by Google which is headquartered in a western democratic and liberal nation that 
vouches to protect freedom of speech and expression, ByteDance-owned TikTok is a product of China – perceived
 to be an authoritarian regime. YouTube videos are many a time taken down, as in CarryMinati’s case, but 
there are apprehensions over the extent to which TikTok can go to remove content from its platform.</p>
<p>While these may be the overarching issues that have the internet divided between YouTube and TikTok, 
a ban of one particular platform for exposing the prevalent cultural problem will be akin to symptomatic 
treatment of chronic disease. The need of the hour is strict policy formulation governing the quality of 
content and strengthened privacy laws for the digital space. More than that, the debate goes back to the 
prejudices prevalent in our society from homophobia to misogyny and class and caste biases that need to 
be addressed online as well as offline.</p>
